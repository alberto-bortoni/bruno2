# BrunO2 Cam Pinch Valve Design Materials

This is an electrically-controlled proportional valve driven by a NEMA 17 stepper motor.  It is a "pinch valve" meaning that the fluid only ever touches the inside of the tubing and flow is restricted by pinching the tubing.  This design pinches the tubing with a roller cam attached to the shaft of the stepper motor.  All components are either 3D printed or common fasteners. The pdf documentation contains further details and flow rate data. Sample Arduino codes are included for controlling the valve with some common stepper drivers.
